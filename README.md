## üí≥ Reactor Wallet

Rector Wallet is an **experimental** wallet for [Solana](https://solana.com/). It's work in progress, expect bugs, use carefully.

### üòé Features
- Experimental [Solana Pay](https://solanapay.com) integration
- Watch over any address you want
- Display SPL Tokens and transactions
- Import and create multiple wallets
- Show the USD equivalent of the address balance and all it's tokens combined
- You can see collectives (aka NFTs)

It should work fine on **Android** and **Windows**, I haven't tried on the other platforms.
